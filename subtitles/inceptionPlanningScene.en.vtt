<c.codd>Codd:</c> Subconscious is motivated by <b>emotion</b> right? Not reason.

*Codd dropping the paper on the table*

00:00:03.999 --> 00:00:07.500 line:90%
<c.codd>Codd:</c> We need to find a way to translate this into an <b>emotional</b> concept.

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:06.500 position:90%

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.999 line:90%
<c.codd>Codd:</c> Now Robert's relationship with his father is stressed to say the least.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.000 line:90%
<c.eames>Eames:</c> Can we run with <b>that</b>?

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.999 line:90%
<c.eames>Eames:</c> We could suggest to him breaking up his fathers company as a 'skrew you' to the old man.

00:00:20.999 --> 00:00:24.500 line:90%
<c.codd>Codd:</c> No 'cause I think <b>positive</b> emotion trumps <b>negative</b> emotion every time.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.000 line:90%
<c.codd>Codd:</c> We all hear for <b>reconciliation</b> or <b>catharsis</b>.

00:00:28.999 --> 00:00:32.200 line:90%
<c.codd>Codd:</c> We need Robert Fisher to have a positive emotional reaction to all of this

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.100 line:90%
<c.eames>Eames:</c> My father accepts that I want to create for myself, not follow in his footsteps.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:40.500 position:90%
*Codd stepping on the floor*

00:00:39.999 --> 00:00:40.999 line:90%
<c.codd>Codd:</c> That might work.

00:00:40.999 --> 00:00:41.999 line:90%
<c.arthur>Arthur:</c> <b>Might</b>?

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.200 line:90%
<c.arthur>Arthur:</c> We are gonna need to do a little better than <b>might<b/>.

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.000 position:90%
*Scarcastic tone*

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.000 line:90%

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.500 line:90%
<c.arthur>Arthur:</c> Forgive me for wanting a little <b>specificity</b> Eames.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:50.999 line:90%
<c.arthur>Arthur:</c> <b>Specificity</b> 

00:00:50.999 --> 00:00:52.500 line:90%
<c.codd>Codd:</c> Inception's not about being specific

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.100 line:90%
<c.codd>Codd:</c> When we get inside is mind, we're gonna have to work with what we <b>find</b>.

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.000 position:90%
*Loud boom of something big dropping*

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:02.000 line:90%
<c.eames>Eames:</c> On the top level, we open up his relationship with his <b>father</b> and say, 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.500 line:90%
<c.eames>Eames:</c> “I will not follow in my father’s footsteps.”

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000 position:90%
*The city unfolds, wires under tension breaking*

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.500 position:90%
*Loud boom of something big dropping*

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.000 line:90%
<c.eames>Eames:</c> Then the next level down we <b>feed</b> him,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.500 line:90%
<c.eames>Eames:</c> “I will create something for myself.”

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.700 line:90%
<c.eames>Eames:</c> Then by the time we hit the bottom level we bring out the big guns.

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.500 line:90%
<c.codd>Codd:</c> "My father doesn't want me to be him".

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:15.000 line:90%
<c.eames>Eames:</c> Exactly
