                <p>Codd: Subconscious is motivated by emotion right? Not reason, so we have to translate this
                    into an emotional concept.</p>
                <p>Arthur: How do you translate a buisness stratagy into an emotion?</p>
                <p>Codd: Thats what we're here to figure out right </p>
                <p> [Binder lands on the table]</p>
                <p>now Robert's relationship with his father is stressed to say the least.</p>
                <p>Eames: Can we run with that? we could suggest to him breaking up his fathers company as a 'skrew
                    you'
                    to the old man.</p>
                <p>Codd: No 'cause I think positive emotion trumps negative emotion every time. We all hear
                    reconciliation or
                    catharsis. We need Robert Fisher to have a positive emotional reaction to all of this</p>
                <p>[Finger tapping on wood]</p>
                <p>Eames: Alright, we'll try this uhmm, my father accepts that I want to create for myself, not follow
                    in
                    his footsteps</p>
                <p>Codd: That might work. </p>
                <p>Arthur: Might? We are gonna need to do a little better than might.</p>
                <p>Eames: Oh, thank you for your contribution Arthur</p>
                <p>Arthur: Forgive me for wanting a little specificity Eames</p>
                <p>Eames: What?</p>
                <p>Arthur: Specificity</p>
                <p>Codd: Inception's not about being specific, when we get inside is mind, we're gonna have to work
                    with
                    what we find </p>
                <p>[Music intensifies]</p>
                <p>[City unfolds, wire under tension breaking sound]</p>
                <p>Eames: On the top level, we open up his relationship with his father… and say, “I will not follow in
                    my
                    father’s footsteps.”, then the next level down we feed him “I will create something for myself.”,
                    then
                    by the time we hit the bottom level we bring out the big guns </p>
                <p>Codd: “My father doesn't want me to be him.”</p>
                <p>Eames: Exactly.</p>
                <p>[Machine sucks]</p>
                <p>Arthur: Three layers down, the dreams are gonna collapse with the slightest disturbance.</p>
                <p>Yusuf: Sedation. For sleep stable enough to create three layers of dreaming… we’ll have to combine it
                    with an extremely powerful sedative.</p>
                <p>[Hand slaps]</p>
                <p>Yusuf: Good night.</p>
                <p>[Pipet clicks]</p>
                <p>Yusuf: The compound we’ll be using to share the dream… creates a clear connection between dreamers…
                    whilst actually accelerating brain function.</p>
                <p>Codd: In other words, more time on each level.</p>
                <p>Yusuf: Brain function in the dream will be about 20 times normal. And when you enter a dream within
                    that
                    dream, the effect is compounded. It’s three dreams, that’s 10 hours times 20…</p>
                <p> Eames: I'm sorry, Maths was never my strong subject. Ho- how much time is that?</p>
                <p>Codd: It’s a week, the first level down. Six months the second level down, and the third level…</p>
                <p>Ariadne: That’s 10 years. Who’d wanna be stuck in a dream for 10 years?</p>
                <p>Yusuf: Depends on the dream.</p>
                <p>Arthur: So once we’ve made the plant, how do we get out? I’m hoping you have something more elegant
                    than shooting me in the head.</p>
                <p>Codd: A kick.</p>
                <p>Ariadne: What’s a kick?</p>
                <p>Eames: This, Ariadne, would be a kick.</p>
                <p>[Chair bonks on floor]</p>
                <p>Codd: It’s that feeling of falling you get that jolts you awake. Snaps you out of the dream.</p>
                <p>[Finger snaps]</p>
                <p>Arthur: Are we gonna feel a kick with this kind of sedation?</p>
                <p>Yusuf: Aah, That’s the clever part. I customised the sedative to leave inner-ear function unimpaired.
                    That way, however deep the sleep, the sleeper still feels falling.</p>
                <p>[Chair scrapes over the floor, Eames grins]</p>
                <p>Yusuf: Or Tipping</p>
                <p>[Chair crashes on to the floor]</p>
                <p>Codd: The trick is to synchronise a kick that can penetrate all three levels.</p>
                <p>Arthur: We could use a musical countdown to synchronise the different kicks.</p>
                <p>[Old french music plays]</p>
                <p>[Music stops suddenly]</p>
                <p>[New suspensefull music starts]</p>
                <p>Eames: He hasn’t got any surgery scheduled, no dental, nothing.</p>
                <p>Codd: Wasn’t he supposed to have a knee operation?</p>
                <p>Eames: Nothing. Nothing that they’ll put him under for, anyway. We need at least a good 10 hours.</p>
                <p>Saito: Sydney to Los Angeles. One of the longest flights in the world. He makes it every two weeks.
                </p>
                <p>Codd: He must be flying private, then.</p>
                <p>Saito: Not if there were unexpected maintenance with his plane.</p>
                <p>Arthur: It would have to be a 747.</p>
                <p>Codd: Why’s that?</p>
                <p>Arthur: On a 747, the pilot’s up top the first-class cabin’s in the nose, so no one would walk
                    through. You’d have to buy out the entire cabin and the first-class flight attendant.</p>
                <p>[Steps on the steps]</p>
                <p>Saito: I bought the airline. It seemed neater</p>
                <p>Codd: Well, looks like we have our 10 hours.</p>
                <p>Codd: Ariadne? Terrific work, by the way.</p>
